Forked only the CIFAR-10 directory to complete the tutorial and make the exercise changes.

-----------------------Original README-----------------------------------

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.
